# Primitive-Pythagorean-triplets
## Copyright Adina-Maria Amzarescu 2022

Racket project for the Programming Paradigms course.

This project was done in 4 stages.

___________________________________________________________

## The first stage:

   File: ppt.rkt

   Writing simple programms. Working with lists and
   recursive functions on the stack.
   
   Main functions:
   * car
   * cdr
   * list
___________________________________________________________

## The second stage:

   File: ppt2.rkt

   The main focus in on curry and uncurry functions and 
   the abstraction of functions with similar implementations.
   
   Using functions like:
   * map
   * apply
   * foldr / foldl

## The third stage:

   File: cryptosystem.rkt

   At this stage it's implemented a cryptosystem with 
   symmetric keys, in which the key generation is based on 
   the theory of Pythagorean triplets.

   Main concept: static variable binding expressions

## Last stage:

   File: ppt3.rkt

   In the final stage the focus is on how we get an entire 
   sequence ordered by TPP, where the order depends on the 
   generation method used. First it is implemented the flow 
   of triplets corresponding to the indexing we worked with 
   in the previous stages, then another stream containing the 
   same triplets in a different order, corresponding to a new 
   method of generation.

   Main concept: streams
